Hi. I'm an acadmic librarian and web developer living and working in Dayton, Ohio. I work at the University of Cincinnati Libraries doing full-stack Ruby on Rails development for digital repositories infrastructure as well as serving as the University of Cincinnati Press Dev Lead. In my time off I enjoy playing music, road cycling, and cooking.
