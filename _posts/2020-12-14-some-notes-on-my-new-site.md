This year has brought many changes for me and my family. We have been fortunate to be able to work remotely and afford to keep in relative isolation. I have been given time to consider how I move through and engage with the world. So far this year I have experienced: 

* Shift in work environment, moving to remote
* Passing of a loved one
* Isolation from friends and family as health precaution
* Remote schooling for a primary school student
* Mindful reduction in social media consumption, weaning off of twitter.com
* Bike rides and golfing
* Continued study in systems administration, dev-ops, and software development

Like many, I think, I have a nagging sense of civic/environmental doom that colors my experiences. I am starting to actively seek affirmative and positive things. Before, as a younger, busy person, I've tolerated the world sort of washing over me and grabbing onto strings in close proximity. I don't want to cast about any longer.

So, not unrelatedly, I want to start documenting some of my notes and work, posting things that I think could be interesting or helpful to others as well as an outlet for writing for myself. I'm learning the ropes with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to revamp my portfolio and write.


Et voila.
